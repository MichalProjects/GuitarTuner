App helps to tune the Guitar
The main function of the program is to display on the screen the frequency of the sound recorded with the use of a microphone. 
Based on the frequency of the sound, the note is determined and the information is displayed on the screen whether the given string is well tuned. 
An additional function of the program is the ability to reproduce the sound of a perfectly tuned string.
